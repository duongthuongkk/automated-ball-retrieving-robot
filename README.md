# automated-ball-retrieving-robot
This project describes a ball-retrieving robot that uses the camera frame to process the frame. Then, data is pushed on the web by a Django server and I can set mode or control robot directions by buttons on this web. To ensure a real-time level, I use a WebSocket protocol provided by Django. Besides, this web is a responsive page that is suitable for design on a native mobile app using the WebView component.
