# Automated ball-retrieving robot

## Descriptions
This project describes an embedded system that can be automatic picked up tennis balls by using a camera. 

## Features
- This is an embedded system built on a single-board computer like Raspberry Pi 4.
- Design a model and hardware connections for this robot using Solidworks.
- Combine process images to detect tennis balls with control the system movements through GPIO and PWM.
- Build a webserver with Django to transfer data from the camera, manage information, and control this system with WebSocket protocol.
- Use asynchronous functions in Python to ensure real-time connections and response to user control requests.
